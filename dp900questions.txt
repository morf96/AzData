Describe an analytics workload on Azure (37 questions)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Azure Synapse Analytics performs complex queries and aggregations on a large amount of relational data.
Provision Synapse SQL pools to quickly execute complex queries accross multiple computer nodes.
MPP > Massively Parallel Processing architecture.
Azure Synapse Analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is
Dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) architecture in Azure Synapse Analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/massively-parallel-processing-mpp-architecture
Analysis Services tabular data in Power BI Desktop: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-analysis-services-tabular-data
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction
OLTP: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/online-transaction-processing

2. Azure HDInsight is a big data processing service which is used to provision and manage a cluster of open-source analytics solutions such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka.
Azure Databricks is a complete analytics platform for big data processing, streaming, and machine learning, optimised for Cloud services on top of Apache Spark.
Azure Analysis Services is a service used to build multidimentional or tabular models using OLAP queries, can combine data from Azure Synapse Analytics, Azude Data Lake Store, Azure Cosmos DB.
Azure Analysis Services: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview
Databricks: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/introduction/
Azure HDInsight: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-overview

3.Databricks can handle batch and stream processing. Complete platform for Big Data procesing and Machine Learning.
Real-time data processin and event streaming from Azure Event Hubs.
Interactive workspace for exploration, data visualisation, collaboration and can run notebooks in R, Python, Scala, SQL.
Azure Event Hubs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/streaming-event-hubs

4.Azure Data Lake store raw data. 
Azure Synapse Analytics used to model and serve data. Can load relational data ingested from Azure Data Factory using Synapse SQL pool.
Azure Synapse Analytics can read unstructured data from Azure Data Lake storage using Polybase. Then combine relational and unstructured data, perfom analytics.
Data Warehouse: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/enterprise-data-warehouse 

5.Azure Data Lake built on top of Azure Blob Storage.
Azure Data Lake storage enables hierachical namespace compatible with Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS).
Azure Data Lake storage provides a layer to access Azure Blob Storage data as an HDFS storage including support to organise files in directories and subdirectories.
Systems like Hadoop in Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics can mount a distributed file system hosted in Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 and use it to process huge volumes of data.
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction

6. Data Warehouse architectire diagram.
Azure Cosmos DB is not part of the Azure data warehouse infrastructure.
 - Raw data: Structured and unstructured.
 - Ingenst Raw data: Azure Data Factory
 - Store data: Azure Data Lake
 - Prepare and transform data: Azure Databricks
 - Model and serve data: Azure Synapse Analytics
Azure Data Factory provides end-to-end support for ETL operations for data warehouse load.
The consolidated data is stored in Azure Blob though Data Lake storage.
Give access to Azure Databricks for data analysis.
Use a native connector to move data from Databricks to Azure Synapse Analytics (acts as a single hub for structured data).
Data factory: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/introduction

7.Azure Data Factory can have multiple pipelines not necessarily running sequentially. 
A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that performs a tsk.
Activities in a pipeline either run sequentially or operate in parallel.
An activity represents a step in a pipeline.
Explore data ingestion pipelines: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-components-of-modern-data-warehouse/3-data-ingestion-pipelines

8.Determine tools for tasks with both relational and non-realtional data.
Extract Data from external sources: Azure Data Factory
Maintain relational and NoSQL data in a data store: Azure Data Lake Storage
Analyse relational and NoSQL data: Azure Synapse Analytics (analyse high volume of sturctured and unstructured data).

9.In Azure Data Factory a pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that define tasks to perform on data.
A Dataset is a representation that maps the data structure inside a pipeline with an extrenal source of destination.
Azure Data Factory uses datasets to perform tasks defines in a pipeline activities to move or transform data.
A linked service is used to povide the connection between a data store and Azure Data Factory.
A Linked service is associated with a dataset and is used to extract or load data in the pipeline.
Linked services in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-linked-services?tabs=data-factory
Datasets in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-datasets-linked-services?tabs=data-factory
Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities?tabs=data-factory

10.Provision services that are compatible with Apache Spark for data processing tasks.
Azure HDInsight is a bit data processing service that is used to provision and manage a cluster of open-source analytics solutions, such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka.
Azure Databricks is a complete platform for big data processing, streaming, machine learning built on top of Apache Spark.
Should not use Azure Data Factory that is used to ingenst both relational and non-relational data from multiple sources.
Should not use Azure data Lake storage that is built on top of Azure Blob storage compatible with HDFS file system for anaytics solutions.
