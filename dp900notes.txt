CORE DATA CONCEPTS
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-data-fundamentals-explore-core-data-concepts/?source=docs&ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=7qeoue46ny4rpn
- Identify common data formats
- Options for storing data in files
- Options for storing data in databases
- Characteristics of transactional data processing solutions
- Characteristics of analytical data processing solution
--------------------------------------------------------
Entitites: Data structures in which this data is organized often represents entities (customers, products, sales orders).
Can classify data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
Structured data adheres to a fixed schema: (all of the data has the same fields or properties)
	- tabular: a schema for structured data entities
	- often stored in a database in which multiple tables can reference one another by using key values in a relational model
Semi-structured data allows for variation between entity instances.
	- One common format for semi-structured data is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
Unstructured data:
	- documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure.
	- The schema of unstructured data is typically defined at query time. This means that data can be loaded onto a data platform in its native format.

SLA:
99.9% Downtime hours per year (8,760 – 8,751.24) = 8.76
99.99% Downtime hours per year (8,760 – 8,759.12) = 0.88
99.999% Downtime hours per year (8,760 – 8,759.91) = 0.09
Total cost of ownership (TCO)
Migrate from physical or virtualized on-premises servers to Azure Virtual Machines: strategy is known as lift and shift.

Understand job responsibilities:
	- Data engineers also work with unstructured data and a wide variety of new data types, such as streaming data:
	  ETL > Extract, Transform, Load:
	  		Extract raw data from a structured or unstructured data pool and migrate it to a staging data repository.
			Transform the data from the source schema to the destination schema.
			Load the transformed data into the data warehouse.
      ELT > An alternative approach is Extract, Load, Transform:
	  		Data is immediately extracted and loaded into a large data repository, such as Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Data Lake Storage.
			Reduces the resource contention on source systems. (disadvantage of the ETL approach is that the transformation stage can take a long time.)
			Data engineers can begin transforming the data as soon as the load is complete.
			The data processing framework a data engineer use to ingest data onto cloud data platforms in Azure.

Cloud technical requirements:
- Maintainability
- HA
- Multilingual support

Data stores: (two broad categories)
- File stores
- Databases
